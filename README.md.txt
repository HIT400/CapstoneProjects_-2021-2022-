The Heart Failure Prediction System (HFPS) using a machine learning effective algorithm uses medical profile of the patient such as gender, blood pressure, blood sugar etc. as input, it can predict the likelihood of patientâ€™s heart failing as either low or high. It then gives necessary treatment options. I am using ANN algorithm to in the modelling of Heart Failure Prediction System. It is implemented using Python as web-based application. It can answer complex queries for diagnosing heart disease and thus assist healthcare practitioners to make intelligent clinical decisions which traditional decision support systems cannot. By providing effective treatments, it also helps to reduce treatment costs.
In this project, the Cleveland CAD dataset from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) was used.

Requirements:
tensorflow - Python library for fast numerical computing
pandas - Python Data Analysis Library
sklearn- robust library for machine learning
