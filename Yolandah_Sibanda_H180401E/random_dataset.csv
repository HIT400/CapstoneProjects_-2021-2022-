"As U.S. budget fight looms, Republicans flip their fiscal script","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a conservative Republican faction in the U.S. Congress, who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts, called himself a ‚Äúfiscal conservative‚Äù on Sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018. In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace the Nation,‚Äù drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense ‚Äúdiscretionary‚Äù spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. ‚ÄúThe (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,‚Äô‚Äù Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. ‚ÄúNow, Democrats are saying that‚Äôs not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don‚Äôt see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people‚Äôs money,‚Äù he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party‚Äôs debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,‚Äù Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. ‚ÄúThis is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we‚Äôve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we‚Äôre going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,‚Äù Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or ‚Äúentitlement reform,‚Äù as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, ‚Äúentitlement‚Äù programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan‚Äôs early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the ‚ÄúDreamers,‚Äù people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. ‚ÄúWe need to do DACA clean,‚Äù she said.  On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid. ",politicsNews,31-Dec-17,1
U.S. military to accept transgender recruits on Monday: Pentagon,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Transgender people will be allowed for the first time to enlist in the U.S. military starting on Monday as ordered by federal courts, the Pentagon said on Friday, after President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban. Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration‚Äôs request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. ‚ÄúThe Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD‚Äôs study and will continue to defend the president‚Äôs lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,‚Äù the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: ‚ÄúAs mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.‚Äù Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal ‚Äúgreat news.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it‚Äôs not good for the military or our country,‚Äù Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama‚Äôs policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military ‚Äúcannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.‚Äù Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump‚Äôs ban while legal challenges to the Republican president‚Äôs policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants‚Äô sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept ‚Äúsome individuals who are not medically fit for service.‚Äù The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump‚Äôs defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president‚Äôs ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity.

What's in Store for Nigerians As Oil Price Surges? Experts Speak,"The price of crude rose to U.S.$130 a barrel, the highest since 2008 as the United States and its European allies considered banning the importation of Russian oil in protest against Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The expectation is that oil-exporting countries will rake in revenues and grow their foreign reserves, while the cost of goods will rise globally. But for a country like Nigeria, which sells crude and buys refined fuel, the effects will not be as straightforward.

Paul Alaje, an economist at SPM Professionals, said, ""The increase in pump price to an unprecedented amount in recent years has shown that the Nigeria government will earn more in revenue from crude, however, as soon as this revenue comes, the Nigerian government will give it out to refineries around the world. ""The direct implication of this is that the government will now need to pay more in subsidies beyond the gauge that was received from revenue. This will also further deplete the potential share of the revenue,"" Alaje said.

The fuel scarcity situation being faced nationwide may further be prolonged because the vessels that bring refined petroleum products into the country from countries around Ukraine and Russia are likely to face some delays.",Oil,8/3/2022,1
The Westís Sanctions on Russia Are Working Too Well,"Russiaís invasion of Ukraine represents the gravest challenge to peace in Europe since World War II, and, according to some, the onset of a new era in world history.

The Westís response has been nearly as monumental. While forswearing military confrontation with Russia, NATO and its allies have waged something akin to financial war on Vladimir Putinís regime. In addition to sanctioning Russiaís oligarchs and seizing their Western assets, the U.S. and E.U. have effectively evicted Russiaís entire banking system from the global financial order. Russian banks can no longer use the international payments known as SWIFT to complete transactions, forcing the firms to conduct business at a snailís pace, one telephone call at a time. Not that Russiaís banks have all that much business to conduct, given that engaging in virtually all forms of commerce with Russia will now expose foreign firms to secondary sanctions.

Even more significant than these measures, however, was the freeze that central banks throughout the West put on Russiaís sovereign assets. Since his invasion of Crimea in 2014, Putin has carefully built up one of the worldís largest reserves of foreign currency. This $640 billion stockpile was intended to give the Russian leader greater freedom of geopolitical maneuver by insulating his economy against the threat of crippling sanctions. One of the worst consequences of sanctions for the penalized nation is that they debase its domestic currency: When most of the world is boycotting Russian exports, demand for rubles dries up. That increases the Kremlinís borrowing costs and the prices that Russian consumers must pay for imported goods. With its giant stockpile of foreign currency, however, the Russian central bank could engineer demand for rubles by buying them up with its own dollars and euros.

But there was a flaw in this plan. Although Russia owns hundreds of billions in foreign currency, those funds are legally stored in central and commercial banks in New York, Paris, Berlin, and other global cities. The West exploited this fact to cut off Russiaís access to its own sovereign wealth.

Never in modern history has an economy of Russiaís scale been subjected to such extraordinary ostracism. The rubleís value swiftly plummeted. According to analysts at JPMorgan Chase, the Russian economy is now poised to shrink by 7 percent this year. Other forecasters paint an even darker picture, with The Institute of International Finance projecting a 15 percent contraction in Russiaís GDP. Putinís regime owes much of its popular legitimacy to the fact that it managed to steer Russia back to economic stability and modest growth after its 1998 debt crisis. That year, the Russian economy shrank by 5.3 percent.

And economists may actually be underestimating the economic difficulties that lie ahead ó for both Russia and its adversaries.

For all their technocratic brutality, the Westís sanctions did include a loophole large enough to run oil tankers through: Transactions involving Russian energy exports, which account for about a quarter of its economy, were exempted from sanctions, so as to spare Western consumers from paying for Putinís sins.

On paper, this provided the Kremlin with a precious lifeline. So long as Russia could carry on selling oil and gas to the U.S. and Europe, it would continue to accrue dollars and euros, which it could then use to prop up the rubleís value. And this has indeed helped to cushion the Russian currencyís fall over the past week.

If the Westís governments threw Putin a lifeline, however, its private sector is steadily cutting through it.

Over the past few days, Western traders and refineries have slashed their purchases of Russian oil, with some ceasing to transact with the Russians altogether. Meanwhile, oil giants Shell and BP both announced that they are abandoning partnerships with Russian state-owned oil companies and halting extraction projects in the country.

ìThe enablers of oil exports ó the banks, insurance companies, tanker companies and even multinational oil companies ó have enacted what amounts to a de facto ban,î Tom Kloza, the global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service, told the New York Times last week.

The motivations behind this emergent boycott vary from firm to firm. For one thing, while Western sanctions include exemptions for the energy trade, executing such transactions without running afoul of some other restriction in the process is a tricky, time-consuming business. Many buyers would simply prefer to do business with less vexsome suppliers. At the same time, some shipping companies do not want to expose their vessels to the risk of attack; shortly after the onset of Putinís invasion, a missile struck a Moldovan oil tanker.

There is also a widespread belief among traders that, as Russia ramps up its attacks on Ukrainian civilians, Western governments will eventually feel compelled to use their remaining economic weapon. So buyers are looking to get ahead of that development by securing new suppliers now. Finally, a lot of participants in the energy trade simply do not want to be bankrolling war crimes (or, at least, to be seen to be doing so). This moral objection to facilitating the Russian energy trade is not confined to executive suites. In Britain on Friday, dockworkers refused to unload a tanker full of Russian gas, thereby forcing the ship to be diverted.

As a result, Russia is struggling to find buyers for its top export, even as it offers the nationís highest quality oil at a discount of $20 a barrel.

Should this de facto embargo continue, the implications will be devastating for Russiaís economy and burdensome for virtually everyone elseís.

ìWeíre in unknown territory if you pull 13 percent to 15 percent of global oil out of the pool,î Brenda Shaffer, a senior adviser for energy at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told CNBC Thursday. ìSanctions on Iran and Venezuela, itís not even comparable to what that could do to the global oil market if you actually pulled away most of Russian production.î Shaffer went on to note that while many are cheering the exit of Shell and BP from Russia as a ìfeel-good moment,î those moves are ìgoing to be a huge, huge shock to the state of these companies and to the stock market in general.î

As of late Friday morning, a barrel of Brent Crude Oil was trading at $114.50, its highest level in nearly a decade. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 500 points on the day.

Given Putinís expansive war aims ó which include the dissolution of the Ukrainian government, and the establishment of a Kremlin-aligned puppet regime in Kyiv ó sanctions are unlikely to be lifted anytime soon. And should they remain in place for much longer, they are likely to permanently reshape the global economy.

Already, European leaders are discussing efforts to durably reduce their reliance on Russian energy through both an acceleration of decarbonization efforts and, in the immediate term, the aggressive pursuit of spare liquefied natural gas from other suppliers. For its part, Russia is likely to pivot its own export strategy away from Europe and toward China.

If Putinís rogue geopolitical strategy is to be remotely sustainable, he will need the partnership of Xi Jinpingís regime. It is not a coincidence that, shortly before Putinís invasion, Russia and China announced a ìno limitsî partnership meant to counterbalance the coercive influence of Western powers. But here, too, Putinís fortifications against economic bombardment have been splintering. Chinaís political leaders have found Putinís offenses against the international order easier to defend in theory than in practice. Following Russiaís haphazard and bloody first days of fighting, Beijing distanced itself from Moscow, declined to support the ruble from Western attack, and called for the protection of civilians in Ukraine.

And Chinaís political leadership is more sympathetic to Russia than its large businesses. Chinese banks have mostly steered clear of Russia since the war began, wary of jeopardizing their access to more profitable Western markets. If China eventually agrees to serve as Russiaís financial savior, Xi will have the leverage to extract lopsided terms of trade from Moscow.

Even if Putin pulls out of Ukraine in a few weeks, and Western nations lift the current sanctions, American and European firms and investors are likely to remain wary of Russia, given the risks inherent to doing business with a rogue state.

Thus, Putinís war of conquest is poised to inaugurate not only a new geopolitical era ó one in which the European Union spends much more on defense and NATO enjoys a new sense of purpose ó but also a new economic one, in which global commerce is increasingly divided between adversarial blocs. These two developments could interact in dangerous ways. As Russia and the West become less economically interconnected, relations between the worldís two largest nuclear powers could become even more tense and tenuous than they were before the present crisis.

In the immediate future, the costs of adjusting to a less globalized economy could be steep. Already stricken with high inflation before Putinís invasion, the West will now see its energy costs explode. In Russia, the scale of devastation and disruption that awaits is difficult to comprehend. For some of the worldís poorest people, meanwhile, a sudden drop in wheat exports from Russia and Ukraine could very well mean starvation.

In drafting its sanctions, the West set out to wreck the Russian economy. At the moment, it appears to be succeeding beyond itís wildest hopes (and/or fears).",politicsNews,7/3/2022,1

"Balenciaga's latest show was a comment on climate crisis, virtual reality and the war in Ukraine","With all eyes on Balenciaga, one of Paris Fashion Week's most anticipated collection unveilings, the brand's creative director Demna used his platform to pay tribute to Ukrainians in a dramatic show that evoked a deep sense of unease about the future.
For the designer, the humanitarian crisis unfolding in eastern Europe, where more than 1.5 million Ukrainians have fled the country, hits close to home.Demna (who prefers not to use his last name) was born in Sukhumi, a city in Georgia that saw heavy fighting during the country's civil war in the early 1990s. The designer and his family were among tens of thousands of people to flee Sukhumi amid conflict in the disputed region of Abkhazia, which is considered independent by Russia despite being internationally recognized as part of Georgia.
""The war in Ukraine has triggered the pain of a past trauma I have carried in me since 1993, when the same thing happened to my home country and I became a forever refugee,"" he wrote, in a note given to guests attending the label's Fall-Winter 2022 show, held Sunday on the outskirts of Paris.
