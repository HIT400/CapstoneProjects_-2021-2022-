Project: Fake News Detection System


How the System Works
The Fake News Detection System is a simple project that can help users search if the piece of news that have seen is True or Fake. The Fake News Detection System's website will prompt users to input their news in the text box and it is then flagged as True of False. After the user has clicked on the 'Predict' button , the system will run its decision tree algorithm and predict the news. Using the News Api, if the news is True, headline(s) will appear showing the source(s) where the news came from. One can follow that link to read more,if need be.
