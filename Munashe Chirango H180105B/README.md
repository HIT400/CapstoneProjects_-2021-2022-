Students Management and Enroll system using Facial Recognition and CNN in Python 

#Softwares Used
Visual Studio Code with Python
QT Designer for UI

#Main Libraries 
Tensorflow
PyQt5

#Main Algorithm used
CNN algorithm 

in this project l took 1 000 images of each of my 3 people to create a data set of 3 000 images to create my test model using CNN Algorithm which is what l used 
to integrate into my students management system for facial recognition and analysis. l created 4 rules on the system for passing courses in part 1 and 2 to proceed,
school fees payment then lastly attachment. the system worked as anticipated with just a few discovories on the limitations of a CNN model which include needing 
same lighting as model light to detect very well.
