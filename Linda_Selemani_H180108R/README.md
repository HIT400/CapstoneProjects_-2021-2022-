# final_year_project for Linda Selemani H180108R

Offers Medical Assistance.

This application is comprised of the Medical Assistant chatbot, a natural language processing bot offers first 
aid help for various medical situations and emergencies.  This chatbot makes use of the common chat interface and 
one can communicate through texting or speech which is then converted to text (voice-to-speech). In this application is also an offline 
help service page which has a list of various medical situations and their respective relief remedies to cater for 
those without access to the internet.  

There is also an emergency dial functionality that enables one to be directly connected to an emergency dial number upon the
click of a button. The application is a quicker solution to helping victims of different accidents, be it at home, work, school or 
anywhere to receive aid and communicate with the responsible aid persons as soon as possible. Other integrations on the 
Medical Assistant Chatbot are available on Facebook  and on the web on https://dev-emabot.pantheonsite.io/.
