The project is a chatbot which uses Natural Language Processing to accept a user's input process it by matching intent with response and give a relevant response.

I used python to develop this chatbot, using the NLTK library (Natural Language ToolKit) which processes language written in the English language.
I used Tensorflow, an open-source software library which is used for machine learning and AI for training and inference of the chatbot. 
Using Tensorflow, i was able to adapt the Keras Model which is Sequential.  This helps in backend neural network computation.



During running of the chatbot, run the app.py file and make sure that tensorflow, numpy, nltk and pandas and pickle are downloaded on the machine.
Also check the folder that contains the app.py and change it in the code to run on local host.
